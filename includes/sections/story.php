                  <p>We've been there. We are still there. All three of us are trying to figure out our lives, but while we do it, we want to help others in their journey too. We don't live fancy lives, at least not from an outsider's perspective. But, we do have some damn fine stories.</p>
                  <p>Sarah and Andrew ran into each other by chance. Inspired by their conversation, Andrew spent the night working on the first semblance of I Am A PROTOTYPE in an airport.</p>
                  <p>Many conversations and months later, a founder lost and a founder gained, the three of us launched this project. We believe in our work's ability to inspire and bring people together.</p>
