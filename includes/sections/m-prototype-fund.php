            <p>When we started this, we knew that we wanted to give back. Each of us have struggled to fund our ideas, or even just to keep the lights on. That’s why 15% of each purchase is put into a revolving fund. In disbursments of $1,000, we’ll give prototypes funding and a bit of mentorship. Applications will open once we’ve built up enough of a fund.</p>
            <p>If you are interested, you should sign up for our newsletter. We'll let you know when the program opens.</p>
