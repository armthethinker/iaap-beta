<p>We&#39;re building and rebuilding ourselves.<br>We make mistakes, then both laugh and cry about them.<br>We know who we want to be, but we’re still figuring out how to get there.<br>We have jobs but they aren&#39;t the ones we&#39;ll keep.<br>We&#39;re still learning what it means to be an adult,<br>but we are not children.</p>
<p>Some of us design.<br>Some of us build.<br>Some of us just work to pay the bills.</p>
<p>It&#39;s time for a signpost.</p>
<p>iamaprototype is a reminder that our stories are still works-in-progress.<br>It&#39;s a reminder to others that life is messy.<br>It&#39;s a call for understanding.<br>Together, we’ll write the new future.</p>
