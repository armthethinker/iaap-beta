<p>We’re building and rebuilding ourselves.<br>We make mistakes, then both laugh and cry about them.<br>We know who we want to be but we’re still figuring out how to get there.<br>We have jobs,<br>but they aren’t the ones we’ll keep.<br>We’re still learning what it means to be an adult,<br>but we are not children.  </p>
<p>We’re the kids with new stories,<br>the baristas,<br>the soon-to-be graduates,<br>the thirty year old stockbroker who’s a poet at heart,<br>the designers,<br>the engineers,<br>the teachers,<br>the scientists,<br>the artists.  </p>
<p>We take our lives into our own hands when we can.<br>We drift when we can’t.<br>We’ll build ourselves, tear ourselves down, and do it again.  </p>
<p>We’re not afraid of learning through failure,<br>but we are a little afraid of being hurt.<br>We don’t always make rent,<br>but we do make experiences.  </p>
<p>We are not alone.<br>The struggle for understanding, it is real –<br>Against our parents, our coworkers, our siblings, our spouses, and every online form that asks us for a short bio.<br>We’re not following the paths that were left out for us.  </p>
<p>In this big experiment we call life,<br>each day is another opportunity to try something new.<br>We might not get it right the first time, but we try.<br>We exhaust ourselves in the pursuit.  </p>
<p>We can’t see the future and our past is scrambled,<br>but we’re putting the pieces together.<br>We see what others can’t:<br>live is unapologetically messy.  </p>
<p>It is for that reason,<br>it is because we can see,<br>we decide to share our stories,<br>our lives,<br>our passions,<br>and our faults.<br>We stand together<br>with connections that are just being realized.<br>We are a community.  </p>
<p>We look into the abyss,<br>shout our name,<br>and say:  </p>
<p>I am a prototype.  </p>
