We’re building and rebuilding ourselves.  
We make mistakes, then both laugh and cry about them.  
We know who we want to be but we’re still figuring out how to get there.  
We have jobs,  
but they aren’t the ones we’ll keep.   
We’re still learning what it means to be an adult,  
but we are not children.  
  
We’re the kids with new stories,  
the baristas,  
the soon-to-be graduates,  
the thirty year old stockbroker who’s a poet at heart,  
the designers,  
the engineers,  
the teachers,  
the scientists,  
the artists.  
  
We take our lives into our own hands when we can.  
We drift when we can’t.  
We’ll build ourselves, break ourselves, and do it again.  
  
We’re not afraid of learning through failure,  
but we are a little afraid of being hurt.  
We don’t always make rent,  
but we do make experiences.  
  
We are not alone.  
The struggle for understanding, it is real –  
Against our parents, our coworkers, our siblings, our spouses, and every online form that asks us for a short bio.  
We’re not following the paths that were left out for us.  
  
In this big experiment we call life,  
each day is another opportunity to try something new.  
We might not get it right the first time, but we try.  
We exhaust ourselves in the pursuit.  
  
We can’t see the future and our past is scrambled,  
but we’re putting the pieces together.  
We see what others can’t:  
live is unapologetically messy.  
  
It is for that reason,  
it is because we can see,  
we decide to share our stories,  
our lives,  
our passions,  
and our faults.  
We stand together  
with connections that are just being realized.  
We are a community.  
  
We look into the abyss,  
shout our name,  
and say:  
  
I am a PROTOTYPE.
