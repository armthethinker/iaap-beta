We're building and rebuilding ourselves.  
We make mistakes, then both laugh and cry about them.  
We know who we want to be, but we’re still figuring out how to get there.  
We have jobs but they aren't the ones we'll keep.  
We're still learning what it means to be an adult,  
but we are not children.
  
Some of us design.  
Some of us build.  
Some of us just work to pay the bills.
  
It's time for a signpost.
  
iamaprototype is a reminder that our stories are still works-in-progress.  
It's a reminder to others that life is messy.  
It's a call for understanding.  
Together, we’ll write the new future.
